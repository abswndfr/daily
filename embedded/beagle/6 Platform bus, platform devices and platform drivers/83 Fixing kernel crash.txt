
There was a crash in the previous lecture.And as I said, that's because, there was an attempt to create

a duplicate device files.Because, we actually didn't change these 'id' numbers.

Please, make this change and also in the platform_exit, you have to register a two more devices.That we

didn't do,

so let's do that.

Two more times you have to call unregister, isn't it?Now, let me

do a make clean and let's build for the host.

Let me first load the

device setup code, and after that, let me load the driver.

Yes, here you can see that, 4 devices have been detected.

These are the names of the devices,

so the probe was successful for every device.

Let me remove the device setup code,

and you can see that,

the device was released successfully.

And now let's once again add the device setup code.

And you can also see that, under dev

the device files have been created. Pcdev0,1,2, and 3.And you can use your file handling driver

methods to check the data transfer between the user space and the kernel space.

I hope you can test that.

Try to reproduce this.And in the next lecture, let's learn more about platform_device and driver matching.

I'll see you in the next lecture.
