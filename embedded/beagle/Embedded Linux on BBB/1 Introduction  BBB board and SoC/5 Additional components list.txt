Additional components requirements for this course

1. Serial Debug cable
	To access the serial(UART) pins of the board for debug purposes, a USB to Serial TTL convertor hardware is required because the Board doesn’t come with on-board serial converter chip .
	
	These are some of the recommendations only if you don’t have any USB to Serial convertor cable or hardware
	
	Note: if you have already bought USB to Serial Convertor hardware for my earlier courses, then you can continue using the same.

2. 5VDC Power Supply

	You can power the board by connecting BBB to your PC using mini USB cable, but the current via the USB port is limited to 500mA by the power management device on the board. The board shuts off if USB current exceeds this range. Also if you want to drive more peripherals, the current will be in sufficient. A DC power supply solves this issue.
	
	Recommended DC power adapter 5V @ 2A
	
	Remember that the operating current recommended to be 1A to 2A, exceeding this range may damage the board.
