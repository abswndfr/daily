Important Note
Dear Students,

Please note

For all the videos udemy auto generated CCs (Closed Captions) are enabled

Auto generated CCs are not 100% accurate.

We are working hard to come up with manually generated CCs

If you donâ€™t want to use the CC, then you can turn it off.

Please do not give bad/negative rating because of the quality of CC since it is udemy auto generated.

Please email to support@udemy.com  if you have any issues with the CCs

Important note about asking questions on the course Q/A discussion board.
